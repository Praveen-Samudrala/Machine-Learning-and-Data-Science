<h1 align="center">Loan Defaulter Predictor App</h1>

# Overview: 

The Loan Defaulter Predictor Application analyses a loan applicant's data and predicts the likeliness of whether the applicant will default the loan or not based on Lending Club's data. The application provides a capability to use a LightGBM model and TF based Neural Network(in works) for prediction, providing choice of model to use.

# Project Planning:

## 1.  Data Exploration
  * Checking missing data using heatmaps.
  * Distribution of dependent variable
  * Visualization of different features to understand relations and distributions.
  * Understanding the correlation between features using heatmaps.

## 2. Data Preprocessing  
  * Handling Null Values - Strategic Imputation with corerlated features and Median.
  * Feature Selection based on Correlation with target and to tackle Multicollinearity.
  * Feature Encoding - Encoded Categorical features and Normalized numerical features.
  * Splitting of Training and Testing data.
  * Upsampling Training data with SMOTE to tackle imbalanced classes.

## 3. Model Building and Evaluation
  * Model Experimentation
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - LightGBM
    - CatBoost
    - XGBosst
    - Sequential ANN model.

  * Evaluation
    - Predictions on test set
    - Evaluation of model with classification report.
    - Evaluating Performance Metrics - TP,TN,FP,FN,Precision,Recall,F1-score,AUROC,AUPRC.

## 4. Inference function
  * Training a model on whole dataset (X and y) without splitting.
  * Function "assess_customer" to assess new customers whether they payback loan or not.
  * Check model predictions on new customer.

## 5. Prediction App with Streamlit
