<h1 align="center">Finding Donors</h1>

# Problem Statement: 

Predict whether a candidate's income exceeds USD 50K/yr based on census data. This helps target candidates to reach out and request donation for a non-profit organization.

**Dataset used**:  
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

# Project Planning:

## 1. Dataset Exploration and Null Hypothesis
## 2. Data PreProcessing
  * Handling Null Values
  * Handling Skewed Data
  * Feature Scaling
  * Encoding Categorical Features
## 3. Model Building
  * Dataset split into Train and Test sets
  * Naive Predictor's Performance
  * Choosing the Supervised Learning models
  * Fine tuning the high performance model using GridSearchCV

## 4. Analysis and Improvement
  * Analyzing the performance and identifying the most important features to challange Null Hypothesis.
  * Improving the model using the important features only.
